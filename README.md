# bottleneck-behaviors
Code from the project "Modeling bottlenecks, modularity, and context-dependency in behavioral control" born at the 2019 Boulder Summer School on Theoretical Biophysics (https://boulderschool.yale.edu/2019/boulder-school-2019). 

The contributions to this work are equally from: Veronika Dubinkina, Anjalika Nande, Riccardo Ravasio and Grace Zhang. The project has been designed and supervised by Gordon Berman.

### Run the neural network simulation

In the Neural network folder the script nn_bottleneck.sh allows for choosing the parameters needed for the NN simulation.
